      <p>
        My name is Shannon, and I’m from a coastal town in Scotland called
        Dunbar. I had always known I wanted to leave my home and see the world,
        and in 2015 I fled the nest to live in Australia for two years and have
        been obsessed with travel ever since. I was living a life of returning
        home, working constantly, saving money, travelling until my money ran
        out and starting over again. <br />
        <br />
        In 2021, I moved back home from what I hoped would be a permanent move
        to Thailand due to the Pandemic. I put all my energy into my remote job
        as an ESL teacher. I built up my regular students and continuously
        filled every slot on my schedule. Although I was finally making good
        money to support myself while travelling once the pandemic was over, I
        realised it wouldn’t give me the freedom I craved, and I was constantly
        feeling burnt out. <br />
        <br />
        I decided to take a massive leap of faith, and I invested in myself. I
        worked with a digital nomad coach who introduced me to the term ‘Virtual
        Assistant’ and it all sort of clicked. I threw all my energy into
        starting my own remote VA business. <br />
        <br />
        I soon realised it was about more than just allowing me to work and
        travel. It has allowed me to make new friends and build a community. I
        get to support other business owners by giving them time for things such
        as taking on new clients, hosting events or even just spending time with
        family. I get to be creative and help bring others’ visions to life,
        which I love. It has given me time to spend with my family, puppers and
        friends. I have time to take courses and learn new skills.
